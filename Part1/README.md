# Part 1
All inputs are from the standard input and the results are shown to the standard output.
All programs can be executed by python xxx.py and the version of python should be larger than 3.6.

## 1. Factorial (4 minutes)
### Input
Input is a single integer N, where 1 <= N <= 100.

## 2. Sorting (1 hour)
### Input
The first line contains a single integer, n, which indicates the size of the array.
The next line contains n integers separated by spaces.

## 3. Matrix Rotation (25 minutes)
### Input
First line contains three space separated integers, M, N and R, where M is the number of rows, N is number of columns in matrix, and R is the number of times the matrix has to be rotated. Then M lines follow, where each line contains N space separated positive integers. These M lines represent the matrix.
